# Project Title : Financial Planning with APIs and Simulations
<br/>
Part 1: A financial planner for emergencies. The members will be able to use this tool to visualize their current savings. The members can then determine if they have enough reserves for an emergency fund.

Part 2: A financial planner for retirement. This tool will forecast the performance of their retirement portfolio in 30 years. To do this, the tool will make an Alpaca API call via the Alpaca SDK to get historical price data for use in Monte Carlo simulations.
Part 2a: Forecasr Cumulative Returns in 10 years by changing the weight of portfolio to 20% bonds and 80% stocks
